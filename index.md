**Generalist developer** with a strong focus on **API development**, past experience with front-ends, management and a little devops. Increasingly involved in the **transformation** of teams and architectures. 

I've worked with mobility (**rail**, mostly), finance, ecommerce and content management systems.

Some clients worth of note: **Apple**, **Trainline**, **JPMorgan** and **Bluecode**.

A couple of consultancies: [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/) and [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/).

Got many years with **Ruby**, worked on several projects with long-lived Rails monoliths, good and bad. Lately doing some **performance tuning**.

I've dabbled with **Elm** and Java, done a few years of Php. Now slowly learning me some Rust.

**What else...**

I really **dislike** the whole passionate ninja rockstar maker bullshit, and hiring hazing practices.

In a past life I was a **History** major and a **photographer**.

I'm **Brazilian/American**, and I'm currently based in Lisbon.

Besides Portuguese and English, I speak (not so good) Catalan, Spanish, and some broken French.

If you're wondering about the **liquidvoting.io** web domain: 

For a couple of years I worked on an [open source Liquid Democracy API](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) for democratic decision-making platforms like [Decidim](https://decidim.org/). The project didn't take off, but I learned a bit about this ecosystem that shows some hope amidst the current distopia of social-networks-driven rage politics and surveillance. Also learned a bunch about open source in general. And from managing a small voluntary team during the pandemic.
