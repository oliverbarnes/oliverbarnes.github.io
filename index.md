## About Me

**Generalist** developer with a strong focus on **web API development**, and experience with frontends, team management, devops, and product. Increasingly involved in the **transformation** of teams and architectures.

Main domains: transport (**rail**, mostly), finance, ecommerce, education and publishing.

Some clients: **Apple**, **JPMorgan**, **Bluecode**, **Trainline** and **Rail Europe**.

Consultancies: [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/) and [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/).

I work in the **US and European markets**.

I've worked on several **large-scale, high traffic applications**.

I have been coding in **Ruby** for well over a decade, on several projects with long-lived Rails monoliths. Lately doing a lot of **performance tuning**.

Also delivered a couple of commercial projects in **Elixir**, dabbled with **Elm** and Java, did a few years of PHP and Javascript.

I am currently working on open source **Rust** projects.

## What else...

In a past life I was a **History** major at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/) (Brazil), and studied **photography** at the [International Center of Photography](https://www.icp.org/) in New York.

I am **Brazilian/American**, binational.

Besides **native English and Portuguese**, I speak (passable) **Catalan**, **Spanish**, **French** and **Italian**.

For a couple of years I worked on an [open source Liquid Democracy API](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) for democratic decision-making platforms like [Decidim](https://decidim.org/) with a few friends and colleagues. The project didn't quite take off, but I learned a lot about this ecosystem that shows promise amidst the current dystopia of social-networks rage politics and surveillance. And about open source in general while at it.
