**Generalist** developer with a strong focus on **web API development**, and experience with frontends, team management, devops, and product. Increasingly involved in the **transformation** of teams and architectures.

I have been coding in **Ruby** for a over a decade, on several projects with long-lived Rails monoliths. Lately doing a lot of **performance tuning**.

Also delivered a couple of commercial projects in **Elixir**, dabbled with **Elm** and Java, did a few years of PHP and Javascript. I am currently learning me some **Rust**.

**What else...**

In a past life I was a **History** major and a **photographer**.

I am Brazilian/American, and I'm currently based in **Lisbon**.

Besides Portuguese and English, I speak (passable) Catalan, Spanish, and some broken French. Starting on Italian now :) Duolingo addict.

For a couple of years I worked on an [open source Liquid Democracy API](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) for democratic decision-making platforms like [Decidim](https://decidim.org/) with a few friends. The project didn't quite take off, but I learned a lot about this ecosystem that shows promise amidst the current dystopia of social-networks rage politics and surveillance. And about open source in general while at it.
