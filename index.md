I see myself as a **generalist** with a strong focus on **web API development**, and experience with front-ends, team management, devops, and product. Increasingly I'm involved in the **transformation** of teams and architectures. 

Main domains I have worked in: mobility (**rail**, mostly), finance, ecommerce and content management systems.

Some clients worth of note: **Apple**, **Trainline**, **Bluecode** and **JPMorgan**.

Consultancies: [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/) and [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/).

I have been coding in **Ruby** for a over a decade, on several projects with long-lived Rails monoliths, good and bad. Lately doing a lot of **performance tuning** of these.

Also delivered a couple of commercial projects in **Elixir**, dabbled with **Elm** and Java, did a few years of PHP and Javascript. I am currently learning me some **Rust**.

**What else...**

In a past life I was a **History** major and a **photographer**.

I am Brazilian/American, and I'm currently based in **Lisbon**.

Besides Portuguese and English, I speak (passable) Catalan, Spanish, and some broken French. Starting on Italian now :) Duolingo addict.

For a couple of years I worked on an [open source Liquid Democracy API](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) for democratic decision-making platforms like [Decidim](https://decidim.org/) with a few friends. The project didn't quite take off, but I learned a bit about this ecosystem that shows some promise amidst the current distopia of social-networks-driven rage politics and surveillance. Also learned a bunch about open source in general.
